# React Native FlatList Blank After API Call

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component remains blank even after successfully fetching data from an API. The loading indicator disappears, suggesting the data fetch is complete, but the FlatList refuses to render the fetched data.

## Problem Description

The `MyComponent` fetches data from a sample API endpoint (`https://api.example.com/data`).  The `useEffect` hook handles the data fetch, and `isLoading` state manages a loading indicator. While the API call is successful and the data is retrieved, the FlatList remains blank.

## Solution

The problem lies in how data is handled.  The solution involves ensuring that the data structure is correctly formatted for the FlatList to render and thoroughly checking for errors during the fetch process to handle unexpected scenarios gracefully.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using your preferred React Native development tools.
4. Observe the blank FlatList after the loading indicator disappears.

## Solution Implemented

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issue by implementing comprehensive error handling and data validation.
